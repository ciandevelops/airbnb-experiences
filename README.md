# Scrimba
Created with this React tutorial from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/)
I used assets provided on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4YjrygFEXOcDp9AAnVFv7o/Airbnb-Experiences?node-id=0%3A1)

# Focus
This is a simple landing page mimicing the Airbnb experiences page.
It deals with a simple example of using 'props' in a project. 

# Issues 

The only issue I encountered was the images. 

Using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) I was able to figure out that I could put the 'images' folder inside the 'public' directory. 

Instead of having to 'import' every single image seperately, I was able to access it anywhere using '/images/example.png'.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
